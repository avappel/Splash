This was a final project for iOS Mobile Application Development at Washington University in St. Louis. Our team decided to create a bathroom and water fountain search and review app.

**Note:** Basic functionalities of the application were completed within the timeframe of the class, and we would like to eventually get to reviving, polishing, and publishing the app in the future. However, our progress on the project has been currently put on hold.

## Feature Summary

1. Ability to find bathrooms and water fountains on a map
1. Filter bathrooms and water fountains by rating, gender, etc
1. Rate and review bathrooms and water fountains
1. 'SOS' feature displays closest bathroom :)
